# Welcome to My Portfolio

**Computer Science + Data Analytics Student**  
Building data-driven applications and tools that turn messy data into clear, actionable insights.

## Home / Introduction

Hi, I'm **Aisha Nur**, a Computer Science student at the University of Washington with a **Minor in Data Analytics** and a **Data Science Certificate in progress (expected 2026)**.  

I enjoy building full-stack applications, designing databases, and using data to answer real-world questions. Recently, I’ve been working with **SQL, Python, Node.js, Tableau, and Salesforce** to support student engagement and program decisions.

## About Me

I started my journey in computer science at **Highline College**, where I earned my **Associate in Computer Science (GPA 3.8)**. I then transferred to the **University of Washington** to pursue my **Bachelor’s in Computer Science** with a **Minor in Data Analytics (current GPA 3.9)**.

My interests sit at the intersection of **software development** and **data analytics**. I love:

- Designing **databases** that actually match real use cases  
- Building **web applications** that connect frontends to real data  
- Using **analytics and visualization** to tell clear stories from data  

I’m also involved outside the classroom. I serve as **Treasurer for the Women in Cybersecurity (WiCyS) Club**, where I help organize events, manage budgets, and create a welcoming space for students exploring security and tech.

In the long term, I’m aiming for roles in **data analytics, data science, or data-focused software engineering**, where I can combine my coding skills with my love for working with real-world datasets.

## Projects (In Progress)

### 1. Student Engagement Database System (TicketTrack)

A full-stack **student engagement tracking system** inspired by real needs at FIUTS, designed to track event attendance, leadership roles, and engagement across multiple programs.

- **Technologies:** Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, Google Cloud Platform (VM), HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, SQL, JSON
- **Key Features:**
  - Fully normalized database (BCNF) with ER diagrams and clear relationships
  - Interactive HTML pages with dynamic queries and filters
  - Support for secure ticket transfer between students using SQL transactions
  - Both **JSON APIs** and **HTML-based responses** for flexibility
- **Challenges & Key Learnings:**
  - Learned how to design a database from scratch and normalize it to BCNF
  - Deployed a real web app using a GCP VM, managing firewall rules and environment setup
  - Practiced connecting frontend forms to backend routes and SQL queries in a clean, testable way

### 2. TicketTrack CRUD Web App

A CRUD-focused web app that manages **event ticket buyers**, built as a foundation for the larger engagement system.

- **Technologies:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, MongoDB, RESTful APIs, JSON
- **What It Does:**
  - Allows users to **create, read, update, and delete** buyer records
  - Stores data in both MySQL (via phpMyAdmin) and MongoDB
  - Uses JSON responses to power dynamic interactions on the frontend
- **Challenges & Key Learnings:**
  - Gained experience designing RESTful routes and structuring Express controllers
  - Learned how to keep frontend and backend in sync through clean API design
  - Practiced handling data in multiple storage systems (SQL and NoSQL)

### 3. Trivia Maze Game

A desktop game that combines **Java, databases, and design patterns**. Players navigate a 4x4 maze by answering questions stored in a database.

- **Technologies:** Java, JavaFX, SQLite, JDBC, MVC, Factory + Memento patterns, Object Serialization
- **Key Features:**
  - GUI built in JavaFX with dynamic question screens
  - Questions loaded from SQLite via JDBC, with support for multiple question types
  - Save/load game state using Java object serialization
  - Audio feedback and “cheat” features for an engaging user experience
- **Challenges & Key Learnings:**
  - Applied **MVC architecture** to separate logic, UI, and data
  - Used **design patterns** (Factory, Memento) to keep the code modular and maintainable
  - Worked in an Agile-style team with iterative sprints and version control
